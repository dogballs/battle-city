Audio files "level-intro.mp3", "high-score.mp3", "game-over.mp3" taken from https://www.zophar.net/music/nintendo-nes-nsf/battle-city.

The rest of audio files are taken from https://www.sounds-resource.com/nes/battlecity/sound/3710/ and converted from WAV to MP3. As my project is not commercial, it seems to be fine using them according to https://www.sounds-resource.com/page/faq/.
