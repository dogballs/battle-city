Commit message guidelines
-------------------------

Borrowed from [AngularJS Git Commit Message Conventions](https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/9941e89d80e2bc58a153)

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on github as well as in various git tools.

### Subject line
Subject line contains succinct description of the change.

#### Allowed `<type>`
* feat (feature)
* fix (bug fix)
* docs (documentation)
* style (formatting, missing semi colons, …)
* refactor
* test (when adding missing tests)
* chore (maintain)

#### Allowed `<scope>`
Scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example renderer, input, collision, map, tank, npc, effect, bullet, etc...

#### `<subject>` text
* use imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end
