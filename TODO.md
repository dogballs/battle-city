- why i need nested scene graph
  - scene offset
    - scene will have it's offset, renderer will add it to all children when rendering, for children it will start at 0,0
  - shield animation connected to tank
    - render inside tank - two sprite materials?
    - have a separate GO - but how to move it along with tank?
- why I DONT NEED IT
  - complex world coordinates
  - powerup can't find all tanks to remove
  - calculate brick wall sprite offset based on offset from field
